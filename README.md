# collective behavior

i'm interested in exploring audience interaction in live digital art.

one way an audience can affect a work in real time is using the devices / phones they carry, which are equipt with a number of sensors, cameras, and microphones.

concepts i'm interested in exploring with these [ including and not limited to ] :

    1. collective action and decision making / swarm behaviour
    2. agency over environment
    3. access

the desire to make this progressed naturally from a piece i created called "surveil yourself" where audiences could use their phone cameras to join a live video feed projected on the walls of a gallery space.

i got inspired by seeing how engaged people became when they could directly affect what they saw.

my goal for this is to create a general all-purpose type tool that digital artists, including myself, could use to explore interaction and / or collective decision making.

i want to prioritize ease of use in the design. i'm not yet going off defined standards, i'm just thinking along the lines of :

    1. audiences shouldn't need to download apps [ or anything else ] to engage with the art.
    2. it should be intuitive. requiring little to no explanation to use.
    3. artists should be able to integrate this into their setups, if they so choose, without needing to know how to code.

live visual tools such as touch designer, max / msp, and unity seem to favour osc [ open sound control ] for networked communication.

given this, i feel like i can justify a sus design decision : the electron app intermediary is only converting the data received to osc ... does it really need to be there? i think yes if
